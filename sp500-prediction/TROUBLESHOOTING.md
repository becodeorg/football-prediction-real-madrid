# Dashboard Troubleshooting Guide

## âœ… Issue Fixed: "Unable to generate prediction. Please check if models are trained."

### What was the problem?
The Streamlit app was using **relative paths** to access the models directory, but when running from the `app/` directory, the path `../models` was resolving incorrectly.

### What was fixed?
Updated the Streamlit app to use **absolute paths** for model and data directories:

```python
# OLD CODE (incorrect paths)
predictor = SP500Predictor()  # Used default relative paths

# NEW CODE (correct absolute paths)
base_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__))
models_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, "models")
data_dir = os.path.join(base_dir, "data")
predictor = SP500Predictor(models_dir=models_dir, data_dir=data_dir)
```

### Files updated:
- `app/streamlit_app.py` - Fixed path resolution in:
  - `get_prediction()` function
  - `get_future_predictions()` function  
  - `get_market_data()` function

## ðŸš€ How to run the enhanced dashboard:

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd sp500-prediction
   ```

2. **Test the system (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python test_dashboard.py
   ```

3. **Run the dashboard:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
   ```

4. **Access the dashboard:**
   Open your browser to: http://localhost:8501

## ðŸŽ¯ What the enhanced dashboard now provides:

### âœ… Current Features:
- **Today's Prediction**: Direction (UP/DOWN) with confidence level
- **Current Market Data**: Real-time S&P 500 price and statistics
- **Model Voting**: See how each ML model voted
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, moving averages
- **Trading Volume**: Volume analysis with moving averages
- **VIX Fear Index**: Market volatility indicator

### ðŸš€ NEW Enhanced Features:
- **5-Day Future Predictions**: Directional forecasts for next 5 trading days
- **Prediction Timeline Chart**: Bar chart showing daily confidence levels
- **Interactive Price Chart**: 
  - Purple dashed line showing predicted price path

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:

### Future Predictions Algorithm:
1. **Load trained models** (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression)
2. **Fetch latest market data** (S&P 500 + VIX)
3. **Engineer features** for each prediction day
4. **Generate ensemble predictions** from all models
5. **Estimate future prices** using volatility-based random walk
6. **Handle weekends** by skipping to next trading day
7. **Visualize results** with interactive charts and tables

### Model Pipeline:
- **Feature Engineering**: 61 technical indicators and lag features
- **Ensemble Voting**: Majority vote from 3 trained models
- **Confidence Scoring**: Average confidence across all models
- **Price Estimation**: Volatility-adjusted random walk with directional bias

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Confirmation:

If you see the following in your test output, everything is working:
```
ðŸŽ‰ ALL TESTS PASSED! Dashboard is ready to run.
```

The dashboard now properly extends beyond "yesterday" with model-generated future predictions, showing exactly where the market is expected to move with confidence levels and visual signals! ðŸ“ˆ
