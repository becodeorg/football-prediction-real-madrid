📘 Project Title
S&P 500 Daily Movement Prediction System
(Adapted from the Belgian Jupiler Pro League Football Match Prediction Project)

🧠 Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, your team should be able to:

Scrape or collect live stock market data (S&P 500).

Train a machine learning model on historical financial data.

Build a Streamlit dashboard for live prediction and visualization.

Automate data collection, model training, and prediction updates.

🔀 Role Split (Team of 4)
Member	Responsibility
Data Engineer 1 (DE1)	Build the data collection system (using APIs like yfinance, Alpha Vantage). Schedule daily updates.
Data Engineer 2 (DE2)	Automate model retraining and deployment (using cron, Airflow, or Azure Functions).
Data Analyst/Scientist 1 (DA1)	Feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and model training. Define target: price up/down/stable.
Data Analyst/Scientist 2 (DA2)	Build the Streamlit dashboard, integrate predictions and live visuals, deploy dashboard.

🧭 Project Steps and Tasks
🔹 Phase 1: Data Collection (DE1)
Use the yfinance Python library to fetch:

Historical S&P 500 data: open, close, high, low, volume

Optional: data for individual S&P 500 companies

Save data in CSV or database (PostgreSQL or SQLite)

Structure a script to fetch the latest daily data

Optional: Add economic indicators (e.g., VIX, interest rate)

🔹 Phase 2: Automation (DE2)
Automate:

Daily data updates (via scheduler or API cron job)

Weekly model retraining

Technologies:

Python scheduler (schedule or apscheduler)

Orchestration: Airflow or Azure Functions

🔹 Phase 3: Modeling (DA1)
Create a labeled dataset:

Target = price movement the next day: up (1), down (0), or stay (optional)

Features: moving averages, RSI, MACD, returns, volume trend, etc.

Train a model (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM)

Evaluate using accuracy, precision/recall, confusion matrix

Save model with joblib or pickle

🔹 Phase 4: Dashboard & Visualization (DA2)
Streamlit app that displays:

Today’s S&P 500 prediction

Historical chart of past 30 days with signals (Buy/Hold/Sell)

Key indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD)

Model performance (optional)

Integrate updated predictions from the latest model

Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or any cloud VM (Azure, Heroku, etc.)

🧩 Optional Features (Nice-to-Have)
Simulated trading strategy: backtest your predictions with fake money

Add news sentiment: integrate financial news with NLP sentiment scoring

Include individual stocks: predict AAPL, TSLA, etc.

Slack/email alerts: trigger alerts if a strong movement is predicted
